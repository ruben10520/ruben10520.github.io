        <div class="funfact">
          <p>A fun fact about Mac Miller's album "Swimming" is that he originally intended to name it "Guidelines" before changing it to "Swimming" just a few weeks before its release. In an interview with Zane Lowe on Beats 1 Radio, Miller explained that he had written the word "swimming" in his notebook and kept coming back to it because of the imagery and the feeling it evoked. He said that he liked the idea of being in water and floating, and that the word "swimming" captured that feeling for him. So, he ultimately decided to go with "Swimming" as the album's title, and even included a track called "Guidelines" as a nod to his original idea.</p>
